== RemoteApplications Demo ==

This is a simple demonstration using RemoteApplications library.

There are two examples: both for connecting to a standalone application and
connecting to a Java Web Start application. The standalone example uses
pre-built application from `lib` directory and the Web Start example connects
to RemoteApplications project pages to download the application.

The test cases are in separate files under `robot-tests` directory.

To run both the test cases, execute:

  python run.py robot-tests
